    <p>SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.</p>

        <h6 class="KING">KING</h6>
        <p class="page2">I would I had that corporal soundness now,
            As when thy father and myself in friendship
            First tried our soldiership! He did look far
            Into the service of the time and was
            Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
            But on us both did haggish age steal on
            And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
            To talk of your good father. In his youth
            He had the wit which I can well observe
            To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
            Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
            Ere they can hide their levity in honour;</p>
            <h6 class="BERTRAM">BERTRAM</h6>
            <p class="page2">His good remembrance, sir,
                Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
                So in approof lives not his epitaph
                As in your royal speech.</p>
