    <h3>All's Well That	Ends Well Henry IV, part 1</h3>
    <h4>Act 1, Scene 2: Paris. The KING's palace.</h4>
    <p>SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.
        <p>Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants</p>
        <h6>KING</h6>
          <p> The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
           Have fought with equal fortune and continue
           A braving war.</p>

        <h6>First Lord</h6>
        <p>So 'tis reported, sir.</p>
       
       <h6> KING</h6>
       <p> Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
        A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
        With caution that the Florentine will move us
        For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
        Prejudicates the business and would seem
        To have us make denial.</p>

       <h6> First Lord</h6>
       <p> His love and wisdom,
            Approved so to your majesty, may plead
           For amplest credence.</p>
        <h6>KING</h6>
       <p> He hath arm'd our answer,
        And Florence is denied before he comes:
        Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
        The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
        To stand on either part.</p>

        <h6>Second Lord</h6>
        <p>It well may serve
        A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
        For breathing and exploit.</p>

       <h6> KING</h6>
        <p>What's he comes here?
        Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</p>
        
       <h6> First Lord</h6>
        <p>It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
        Young Bertram.</p>
        
        <h6>KING</h6>
        <p>Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
        Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
        Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
        Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
