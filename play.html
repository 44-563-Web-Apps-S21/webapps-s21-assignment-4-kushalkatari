    <h3>All's Well That	Ends Well Henry IV, part 1</h3>
    <h4>Act 1, Scene 2: Paris. The KING's palace.</h4>
    <p>SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.
        <p>Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants</p>
        <h6>KING</h6>
       <p> The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;</p>
          <p> Have fought with equal fortune and continue</p>
            <p>A braving war.</p>

        <h6>First Lord</h6>
        <p>So 'tis reported, sir.</p>
       
       <h6> KING</h6>
       <p> Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it</p>
        <p>A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,</p>
        <p>With caution that the Florentine will move us</p>
        <p>For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend</p>
        <p>Prejudicates the business and would seem</p>
        <p>To have us make denial.</p>

       <h6> First Lord</h6>
       <p> His love and wisdom,</p>
            <p>Approved so to your majesty, may plead</p>
           <p>For amplest credence.</p>

        <h6>KING</h6>
       <p> He hath arm'd our answer,</p>
        <p>And Florence is denied before he comes:</p>
        <p>Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see</p>
        <p>The Tuscan service, freely have they leave</p>
        <p>To stand on either part.</p>

        <h6>Second Lord</h6>
        <p>It well may serve</p>
        <p>A nursery to our gentry, who are sick</p>
        <p>For breathing and exploit.</p>

       <h6> KING</h6>
        <p>What's he comes here?</p>
        <p>Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</p>
        
       <h6> First Lord</h6>
        <p>It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,</p>
        <p>Young Bertram.</p>
        
        <h6>KING</h6>
        <p>Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;</p>
        <p>Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,</p>
        <p>Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts</p>
        <p>Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
      </p>
