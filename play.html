    <h3>All's Well That	Ends Well Henry IV, part 1</h3>
    <h4>Act 1, Scene 2: Paris. The KING's palace.</h4>
    <p>SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.
        Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants
        KING
        The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;Have fought with equal fortune and continue
        A braving war.
        First Lord
        So 'tis reported, sir.
        KING
        Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
        A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
        With caution that the Florentine will move us
        For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
        Prejudicates the business and would seem
        To have us make denial.
        First Lord
        His love and wisdom,
        Approved so to your majesty, may plead
        For amplest credence.
        KING
        He hath arm'd our answer,
        And Florence is denied before he comes:
        Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
        The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
        To stand on either part.
        Second Lord
        It well may serve
        A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
        For breathing and exploit.
        KING
        What's he comes here?
        Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES
        
        First Lord
        It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
        Young Bertram.
        KING
        Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
        Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
        Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
        Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
